# Transferable experience: tranche 1

Protocol: docs/M5-PROTOCOL.md

## Slice 0: what is actually here

every dependency the brief names was checked in the real repository before anything was built

- **m1**: implemented and measured, 80 cases, three systems, the same decision in all 80. Negative result, unchanged.
- **m2**: implemented. src/continuation.rs, 19 public items. Capability for C2 only; the baselines have no export, so no cost comparison exists.
- **m3**: implemented and restored by ADR-004 after the reversal case fired.
- **m4**: alternatives and receipts only. No decision, no attempt, no failure record, no rationale: a grep for those four words returns zero in src/branch.rs. M5's failure memory is therefore owned by M5, as the brief's own section 15 defines TransferAttempt.
- **uni**: confirmed against the real repository rather than taken on trust: uni-evidence, uni-decision, uni-verify, incremental content-bound evidence, STALE, uni brief, uni bundle verify. The brief's description of the boundary is accurate.
- **productPaths**: IntentLane and Kollio are outside this workspace's boundary and Kollio is dirty with concurrent work. Slices 7 and 8 are recorded as not attempted rather than approximated.

## The corpus

30 closed cases.

| Family | Cases | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| exact transfer | 6 | directly_reusable |
| adaptable transfer | 6 | adaptation_required |
| deceptive similarity | 6 | incompatible |
| insufficient or unknown | 12 | additional_evidence_required and insufficient_information |

Not the 96-case corpus: the brief's 96-case corpus, bounded generative trees, the B and C UNI integrations and the JSONL fixture format are tranche 2 and are not claimed here. The score above is not re-scored and does not change. A 96-case corpus over the full published alphabet does now exist, built for the ADR-005 reversal condition rather than for this milestone, and it is recorded in experiments/wide-corpus. It separated the baseline from the planner on cases the baseline's model cannot carry and on none of the cases both models can express, which is a statement about what the 30 cases above covered and not a rescoring of them.

## Metrics

| Metric | Kernel | Baseline A | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| falseDirectTransfer | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| falseIncompatibility | 0 | 0 | - |
| relevantFailureNotSurfaced | 0 | - | - |
| sourceAssurancePromotedToTarget | 0 | - | - |
| unknownCollapsedToFact | 0 | - | - |


## The prediction, and whether it held

Made: A and C are expected to tie on the closed corpus, because a competent baseline that compares the same declared conditions with the same unknown state does the same work in fewer lines.

Held: **true**

the safety metric is perfect on both sides, so it does not separate them. The prediction named fewer lines, and the line count is what condition 5 is scored on: the tie plus a smaller baseline is the brief's reduction trigger, and it fires. Tranche 2 is not funded.

## Mutations

| Mutation | Failed a test |
|---|---|
| promote an unknown fact to a satisfied value | yes |
| treat a not-observed capability as unavailable | yes |
| copy source assurance onto the instantiated target candidate | yes |
| drop a recurrent prior failure from the verdict | yes |
| let a known violating fact fall through to directly reusable | yes |
| accept a plan whose target context revision moved | yes |
| treat an explicitly absent fact as unknown | yes |

## The continuation gate, scored

the brief's seven conditions, scored against this artifact. Condition 5 is scored on complexity per Amendment 1 in docs/M5-PROTOCOL.md, and the verdict counts the conditions rather than asserting a number.

| Condition | Met |
|---|---|
| closed-profile false direct transfers are zero | yes |
| unknown target conditions are never silently promoted | yes |
| source assurance is never silently promoted | yes |
| one benchmark class safely avoids target work | **no** |
| the competent baseline does not give the same result at lower complexity | **no** |
| one real IntentLane transfer demonstrates measurable reuse | **unreachable** |
| Kollio consumes the same core without reimplementing it | **unreachable** |

3 met, 2 not met, 2 unreachable. M5 is funded up to the benchmark and no further, which is what the protocol said before the run, and the brief's reduction trigger fires: the competent baseline gives the same safety and reuse at lower complexity, so the Kernel is to be reduced to the smallest useful portable experience representation.

## Not measured

- no transfer measurement in euros, tokens or human time; avoided work is a count of obligations and nothing more
- no B or C baseline using UNI, so no assurance-integration comparison exists
- no retrieval quality measurement: a capsule is handed to the planner, so the discovery problem is not exercised at all
- no generative bounded trees, no seeds, no counterexample reduction
- no real consumer: the corpus is closed invented arithmetic
